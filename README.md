### I am a passionate Cybersecurity Student at WGU.
***

I've always been curious about how things work, especially regarding technology and digital security. Currently venturing into Cybersecurity, I find myself fascinated by networks and encryption. I have always had a passion for problem-solving and strategies; I started my journey in tech when I was 13. I started programming and managed to develop my own video game! Since then, I have learned more programming languages and fell in love with Cybersecurity.

I'll admit, i'm relatively new to this field, but my enthusiasm for learning drives me to explore every aspect of cybersecurityâ€”from ethical hacking to risk management. Beyond academics, I'm an avid chess player. Just like in cybersecurity, chess challenges me to think strategically and anticipate movesâ€”a skill that I believe translates well into my studies and future career.
 
Let's connect and share our journeys of discovery, we could also have a chess dual :)!
